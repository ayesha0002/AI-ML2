# AI/ML Internship Projects 

This repository contains three machine learning tasks completed as part of my internship:

Task 1: News Classification with BERT
- Fine-tuned a BERT model to classify news headlines into categories (AG News).
- Compared zero-shot and fine-tuned results.
- 
Task 2: Auto Tagging Support Tickets Using LLM
- Used prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning to classify support tickets with top-3 relevant tags.
- 
Task 3: Multimodal Housing Price Prediction
- Combined CNN image features + tabular data.
- Predicted house prices using a neural network with image + structured inputs.


Each folder contains the code notebook and sample data used in the task.
